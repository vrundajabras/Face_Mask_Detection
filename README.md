# Face_Mask_Detection
The very basic cause for transmission of infectious diseases is respiratory
droplets that are generated when the person coughs or sneezes.
The person can be at a huge risk if he/she is in close contact
with the person who is having respiratory symptoms of
any infectious disease like Covid-19 and is constantly coughing and sneezing.
It is necessary to cover the face with a mask to reduce the risk of
being infected.
This can be only avoided by making proper use of a mask. To
check whether mask wear by user is appropriate or not this CNN based face mask detection can be used.
